## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have Flutter (version 3.13 or later) installed.
-   An internet connection to fetch map tiles and API data.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://your-repository-url.git](https://your-repository-url.git)
    cd your_project_directory
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root of the project, create a file named `.env` and add your Google Apps Script URL:
    ```
    APPS_SCRIPT_URL=[https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_ID/exec](https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_ID/exec)
    ```

3.  **Fetch packages:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Platform Setup

-   **Android:** Location permissions are handled by `geolocator`. No other setup is required for debugging.
-   **iOS:** Make sure to provide a description for location usage in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
-   **Web:** Location access requires a secure context (`localhost` or `https://`). The permission prompt is triggered by a user action (clicking the "My Location" button).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

-   **`lib/main.dart`**: The main entry point of the app, containing the home page, state management, and primary UI widgets. It handles all map interactions and state changes.
-   **`lib/models/vendor.dart`**: Defines the `Vendor` data model, including a `copyWith` method for immutable state updates.
-   **`lib/widgets/vendor_bottom_sheet.dart`**: A separate, reusable widget for displaying detailed vendor information.
-   **Services (Google Apps Script):** All external data (vendor lists, distance calculations, geocoding) is fetched from a single, robust Google Apps Script endpoint.
-   **State Management:** The app uses `StatefulWidget` and `setState` for managing the UI state, including user location, vendor lists, and loading statuses.
